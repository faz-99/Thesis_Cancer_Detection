## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Early and accurate detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes and survival rates. Traditional histopathological analysis, while being the gold standard, is time-consuming, subjective, and requires extensive expertise. The advent of deep learning has opened new possibilities for automated medical image analysis, offering the potential to assist pathologists in making more accurate and consistent diagnoses.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Current challenges in breast cancer histopathological analysis include:
- High inter-observer variability among pathologists
- Time-intensive manual analysis process
- Limited availability of expert pathologists
- Subjective interpretation of complex tissue patterns
- Need for consistent analysis across different magnification levels

### 1.3 Research Objectives

This research aims to:
1. Develop an automated breast cancer detection system using deep learning
2. Implement and evaluate EfficientNetB0 as a baseline architecture
3. Address class imbalance through advanced sampling techniques
4. Explore GAN-based data augmentation for improved generalization
5. Investigate SupConViT for enhanced feature learning
6. Develop multimodal learning approaches

### 1.4 Thesis Organization

This thesis is organized into eight chapters covering literature review, methodology, implementation, experiments, results, and conclusions.

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Medical Image Analysis in Oncology

Medical image analysis has evolved significantly with the introduction of deep learning techniques. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown remarkable success in various medical imaging tasks, including radiology, pathology, and dermatology.

### 2.2 Breast Cancer Detection Approaches

Traditional approaches to breast cancer detection in histopathological images relied on handcrafted features and classical machine learning algorithms. Recent advances in deep learning have enabled end-to-end learning approaches that can automatically extract relevant features from raw images.

### 2.3 Transfer Learning in Medical Imaging

Transfer learning has proven particularly effective in medical imaging due to limited dataset sizes. Pre-trained models on ImageNet have shown excellent performance when fine-tuned on medical datasets.

### 2.4 Class Imbalance in Medical Datasets

Medical datasets often suffer from class imbalance, where certain disease types are underrepresented. Various techniques including weighted sampling, focal loss, and synthetic data generation have been proposed to address this challenge.

## 3. Dataset and Methodology

### 3.1 Datasets

#### 3.1.1 BreakHis Dataset

The BreakHis dataset contains 7,909 microscopic images of breast tumor tissue collected from 82 patients. The dataset includes:
- **Benign classes:** Adenosis, Fibroadenoma, Phyllodes Tumor, Tubular Adenoma
- **Malignant classes:** Ductal Carcinoma, Lobular Carcinoma, Mucinous Carcinoma, Papillary Carcinoma
- **Magnifications:** 40X, 100X, 200X, 400X

#### 3.1.2 BACH Dataset

The BACH (Breast Cancer Histology) dataset from the ICIAR 2018 challenge provides high-resolution histopathological images:

- **Source:** ICIAR 2018 Challenge
- **Characteristics:** Perfectly balanced dataset with clinical-grade image quality

#### 3.1.3 Combined Dataset Strategy

To leverage both datasets, we implement a unified classification approach:
- **BreakHis mapping:** Benign subclasses → Benign, Malignant subclasses → Malignant
- **BACH integration:** Direct mapping to unified categories
