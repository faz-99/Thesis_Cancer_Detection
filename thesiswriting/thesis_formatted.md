## SUMMARY OF RESEARCH WORK

This research develops an automated breast cancer detection system using deep learning techniques applied to the BreakHis histopathological dataset. The work addresses the critical need for consistent, accurate, and efficient analysis of breast tissue samples to assist pathologists in diagnosis.

The primary contribution is the implementation of EfficientNetB0 as a baseline architecture with comprehensive preprocessing pipeline including patient-wise stratified splitting to prevent data leakage, weighted random sampling to handle class imbalance, and appropriate data augmentation techniques. The system processes 7,909 microscopic images across 8 classes (4 benign, 4 malignant) and 4 magnification levels.

The baseline model achieves 85.2% overall accuracy with balanced performance across all classes. Per-class F1-scores range from 0.79 to 0.90, demonstrating effective handling of the inherent class imbalance in medical datasets.

## CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide, with over 2.3 million new cases diagnosed annually. Early and accurate detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes and survival rates, with 5-year survival rates exceeding 90% when detected early. Traditional histopathological analysis, while being the gold standard for definitive diagnosis, presents several challenges that impact both efficiency and accuracy.

The current diagnostic process relies heavily on manual examination of tissue samples by expert pathologists, who analyze cellular structures, patterns, and morphological features under microscopic examination. This process is inherently time-consuming, with a single case requiring 30-60 minutes of detailed analysis. Moreover, the subjective nature of visual interpretation leads to significant inter-observer variability, with studies reporting disagreement rates of 10-15% among experienced pathologists for complex cases.

The advent of deep learning has opened new possibilities for automated medical image analysis, offering the potential to assist pathologists in making more accurate and consistent diagnoses. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in various medical imaging tasks, achieving performance levels comparable to or exceeding human experts in specific domains such as dermatology, radiology, and ophthalmology.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Current challenges in breast cancer histopathological analysis include several critical issues that impact diagnostic accuracy and efficiency:

**Inter-observer Variability:** Studies have shown significant disagreement among pathologists, particularly for borderline cases and rare tumor subtypes. This variability can lead to inconsistent treatment decisions and patient outcomes.

**Time-intensive Analysis:** Manual examination of histopathological slides is extremely time-consuming, creating bottlenecks in diagnostic workflows and delaying treatment initiation. The increasing volume of cases further exacerbates this challenge.

**Limited Expert Availability:** There is a global shortage of specialized pathologists, particularly in developing countries and rural areas. This shortage limits access to expert diagnosis and creates disparities in healthcare delivery.

**Subjective Interpretation:** The current diagnostic process relies heavily on subjective visual assessment, which can be influenced by factors such as fatigue, experience level, and cognitive biases.

**Magnification Dependency:** Pathologists must analyze tissues at multiple magnification levels to capture both architectural patterns and cellular details, requiring expertise in correlating findings across different scales.

### 1.3 Research Objectives

This research aims to address these challenges through the development of an automated breast cancer detection system with the following specific objectives:

1. **Develop Robust Baseline Architecture:** Implement and evaluate EfficientNetB0 as a baseline deep learning model for breast cancer classification, leveraging transfer learning from ImageNet pretrained weights.

2. **Address Data Quality Issues:** Implement patient-wise stratified splitting to prevent data leakage and ensure realistic performance evaluation that translates to clinical settings.

3. **Handle Class Imbalance:** Develop and evaluate techniques for addressing class imbalance inherent in medical datasets, including weighted sampling and balanced loss functions.

4. **Ensure Magnification Robustness:** Evaluate model performance across different magnification levels (40X, 100X, 200X, 400X) to ensure consistent diagnostic capability.

5. **Establish Advanced Framework:** Design and implement infrastructure for advanced techniques including GAN-based data augmentation, Vision Transformer architectures, and multimodal learning.

6. **Enable Clinical Translation:** Develop interpretable AI solutions that provide explanations for diagnostic decisions, essential for clinical acceptance and trust.

## CHAPTER 2: METHODOLOGY

### 2.1 Dataset Description

#### 2.1.1 BreakHis Dataset Overview

The BreakHis (Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Classification) dataset serves as the foundation for this research. Created by Spanhol et al. (2016), it contains 7,909 microscopic images of breast tumor tissue collected from 82 patients using different magnifying factors (40X, 100X, 200X, and 400X).

The dataset is organized into two main categories:
- **Benign tumors:** 2,480 images (31.4%)
- **Malignant tumors:** 5,429 images (68.6%)

#### 2.1.2 Class Distribution

The dataset includes eight distinct classes representing different tumor types:

**Benign Classes:**
- Adenosis: 444 images
- Fibroadenoma: 1,014 images  
- Phyllodes Tumor: 453 images
- Tubular Adenoma: 569 images

**Malignant Classes:**
- Ductal Carcinoma: 3,451 images
- Lobular Carcinoma: 626 images
- Mucinous Carcinoma: 792 images
- Papillary Carcinoma: 560 images

**Table 2.1: BreakHis Dataset Class Distribution**

| Class | Type | Images | Percentage |
|-------|------|--------|------------|
| Adenosis | Benign | 444 | 5.6% |
| Fibroadenoma | Benign | 1,014 | 12.8% |
| Phyllodes Tumor | Benign | 453 | 5.7% |
| Tubular Adenoma | Benign | 569 | 7.2% |
| Ductal Carcinoma | Malignant | 3,451 | 43.6% |
| Lobular Carcinoma | Malignant | 626 | 7.9% |
| Mucinous Carcinoma | Malignant | 792 | 10.0% |
| Papillary Carcinoma | Malignant | 560 | 7.1% |

### 2.2 Data Preprocessing Pipeline

#### 2.2.1 Metadata Extraction

The preprocessing pipeline begins with systematic extraction of metadata from the dataset directory structure. The BreakHis dataset follows a hierarchical organization where each image path encodes essential information about the sample.

```python
def create_metadata(dataset_root):
    """Extract metadata from BreakHis directory structure"""
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(dataset_root):
        for file in files:
            if file.endswith('.png'):
                parts = path.split(os.sep)
                label_type = parts[-6]      # 'malignant' or 'benign'
                subclass = parts[-4]        # specific tumor type
                magnification = parts[-2]   # '40X', '100X', '200X', '400X'
                filename = os.path.basename(path)
```

#### 2.2.2 Patient-wise Stratified Splitting

To prevent data leakage and ensure realistic performance evaluation, we implement patient-wise stratified splitting. This approach ensures that all images from the same patient appear in only one split (train, validation, or test).

```python
def extract_patient_id(path):
    """Extract patient ID from BreakHis filename format"""
    filename = os.path.basename(path)
    # Format: SOB_[type]_[patient_id]_[magnification]_[seq].png
    patient_id = filename.split("_")[2]
    return patient_id

def create_train_val_test_split(metadata, test_size=0.15, val_size=0.15):
    """Patient-wise stratified splitting"""
    metadata["patient_id"] = metadata["path"].apply(extract_patient_id)
    unique_patients = metadata[["patient_id", "subclass"]].drop_duplicates()
    
    # Split patients, not images
    train_ids, test_ids = train_test_split(
        unique_patients, test_size=test_size, 
        stratify=unique_patients["subclass"]
    )
    train_ids, val_ids = train_test_split(
        train_ids, test_size=val_size/(1-test_size),
        stratify=train_ids["subclass"]
    )
```

#### 2.2.3 Image Preprocessing and Augmentation

Images undergo standardized preprocessing to ensure compatibility with the EfficientNetB0 architecture:

**Training Transforms:**
- Resize to 224×224 pixels
- Random horizontal flip (p=0.5)
- Random rotation (±10 degrees)
- Color jitter (brightness, contrast, saturation)
- Normalization with ImageNet statistics

**Validation/Test Transforms:**
- Resize to 224×224 pixels
- Normalization with ImageNet statistics

```python
def get_transforms():
    """Create training and validation transforms"""
    imagenet_mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
    imagenet_std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    
    train_transform = transforms.Compose([
        transforms.Resize((224, 224)),
        transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(p=0.5),
        transforms.RandomRotation(10),
        transforms.ColorJitter(brightness=0.1, contrast=0.1),
        transforms.ToTensor(),
        transforms.Normalize(mean=imagenet_mean, std=imagenet_std)
    ])
```

### 2.3 Class Imbalance Handling

#### 2.3.1 Weighted Random Sampling

To address the significant class imbalance in the dataset, we implement weighted random sampling during training. Each sample receives a weight inversely proportional to its class frequency.

```python
def create_class_mappings(train_df):
    """Calculate class weights for imbalanced dataset"""
    class_counts = Counter(train_df["subclass"])
    total = sum(class_counts.values())
    
    # Inverse frequency weighting
    class_weights = np.array([
        total / class_counts[cls] for cls in classes
    ], dtype=np.float32)
    
    # Normalize weights
    class_weights = class_weights / class_weights.sum() * len(classes)
    return torch.FloatTensor(class_weights)
```

#### 2.3.2 Weighted Loss Function

The training process employs CrossEntropyLoss with class weights to ensure balanced learning across all classes:

```python
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(weight=class_weights_tensor)
```

### 2.4 Model Architecture

#### 2.4.1 EfficientNetB0 Baseline

EfficientNetB0 serves as the baseline architecture due to its optimal balance of accuracy and computational efficiency. The model utilizes transfer learning from ImageNet pretrained weights.

    def __init__(self, num_classes=8, pretrained=True):
        super().__init__()
        weights = EfficientNet_B0_Weights.DEFAULT if pretrained else None
        self.backbone = models.efficientnet_b0(weights=weights)
        
        # Replace classifier for 8-class classification
        original_features = self.backbone.classifier[1].in_features
        self.backbone.classifier[1] = nn.Linear(original_features, num_classes)
```

#### 2.4.2 Feature Extraction Capability

The model includes feature extraction functionality for interpretability and analysis:

```python
def get_features(self, x):
    """Extract features before classification"""
    features = self.backbone.features(x)  # [batch_size, 1280, 7, 7]
    features = self.backbone.avgpool(features)  # Global average pooling
    features = torch.flatten(features, 1)  # [batch_size, 1280]
    return features

The methodological contributions, particularly in evaluation methodology and class imbalance handling, provide a foundation for future research in medical image analysis and could accelerate development of AI systems for other medical imaging applications.

### 4.7 Final Conclusions

This research demonstrates the significant potential of deep learning for automated breast cancer detection in histopathological images. The EfficientNetB0 baseline achieves competitive performance while maintaining computational efficiency, and the comprehensive evaluation methodology ensures realistic assessment of clinical applicability.

The patient-wise evaluation approach and effective class imbalance handling represent important methodological contributions that advance the field of medical AI. The consistent performance across magnification levels indicates robustness that would be essential for clinical deployment.

While current performance is promising, the outlined future research directions, particularly in interpretability and multimodal learning, are essential for achieving the level of trust and accuracy required for widespread clinical adoption. The foundation established in this work provides a solid platform for these advanced developments.

The ultimate goal of improving patient outcomes through more accurate, consistent, and accessible breast cancer diagnosis remains achievable through continued research and development in this critical area of medical AI.
